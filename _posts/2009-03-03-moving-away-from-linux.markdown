Since I bought my [MacBook Air](/2008/a-mac) [some time ago](/2008/the-mac-is-mine-now), I figured that I wanted to replace my main working machine, currently running Gentoo Linux, with a Mac as well. But after purchasing the Air, which was more than expensive, I couldn't afford another one, and when I could, rumor had it that the new, refreshed Mac Minis were right around the corner. So I waited. And waited. And waited.

Finally, today, Apple released their new Mac Minis. And I ordered one.
Looks like it's ready to ship anytime now, and I should have it sometime next week if nothing goes wrong.

My current machine, `aeglos`, is going to sit next to the TV, displaying all kinds of movies and series, and the Mini, currently unnamed, will be used for more serious work. Wondered if I might dual-boot `aeglos` with Windows, so I could play a few more games every now and then as well.

Decided to go with the most basic Mini, with only a single GB of RAM. That, of course, has to change. But since ordering the parts from the local electronic shop was less than half the price, I decided to be cheap and go that route. Hopefully not that hard to do things like that manually.
