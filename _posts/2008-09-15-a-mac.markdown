Finally got some money, and so I ran off to the nearest Apple-store (online of course), and purchased myself a [MacBook Air](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air?mco=MTE4MTY).

So now I'm [constantly refreshing the tracking page](http://xkcd.com/281/), waiting for it to be sent. Expected to be delivered between Friday 19th and Tuesday 23rd.

Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!
