All of a sudden, summer is upon us. I'm walking around nearly naked, fan on 24/7, and the door open most of the time. It's almost unbearably hot here. The dog has moved into the basement with me, since the basement is the coolest place in the house right now.

So what do we do then? We watch [The Dark Knight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/). Twice. It rocked! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. If going to the cinema wasn't so expensive, I might have seen it one more time already. But now I think I'll just wait for the DVD (or Blu-Ray).

The people I was working for decided to hire me for another month, until the school starts, so then I have a full-time job with a "normal" pay, and after that, I can work part-time helping with stuff.

Finally, been reading [Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/), and enjoying it. Should absolutely learn something here. Just get some other things out of the way, and I'll start on iEye, and actually making something out of it this time. As they say, [ideas are worthless](http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/08/26/ooobeh).
