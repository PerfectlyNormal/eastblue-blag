## And here we go again!

Another blog. Wonder how long it will take for this one to become horribly outdated, and in the end, removed. Figured since I'm already paying for eastblue.org which is, at the moment, almost not used at all, I might as well use it for something.

And since they don't support Ruby on Rails, using _Blag2_ was not an option. Not that I would want to run it, as I never finished it (big suprise!) and it wasn't working the way I wanted. So now, I'm testing Textpattern.

Not entirely happy with the default looks. It's a bit simplistic, even for me. So I'll see if I can't hack together something soon. Anything to avoid doing anything useful.
