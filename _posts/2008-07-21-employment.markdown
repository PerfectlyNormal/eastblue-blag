Just started working today. Only Flash (ActionScript 3) for now, but possibly some PHP and sysadmin-tasks as well later on.

The Bad Things:

* Travelling there takes a long time. Think I might try to work from home instead, if that's possible.
* No Subversion/Git/CVS/Mercurial/Some other SCM
* No bugtracker (that I know of)

The Good Things:

* The code isn't [The Daily WTF-material](http://thedailywtf.com/) (yet)
* I'll actually make some money, so I can afford things I want
* It's interesting work
* Should be possible to convince them to add a bugtracker and/or some SCM
* Had to sign an NDA just to look at their code. Makes it seem so much more secrety and fun.
