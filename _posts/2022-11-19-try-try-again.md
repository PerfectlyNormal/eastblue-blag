Only four years, nine months and twelve days since the last post.
Might be getting the hang of this now. But with the ongoing collapse
of Twitter, seems like a good idea to get back into writing a bit every
now and then.

Looking back, the [First Real Post]({% post_url 2008-01-29-first-real-post %})
was made in the end of January 2008, so _technically_ I've been blogging
for close to 15 years in this incarnation. With a few gaps here and there.

* 2008: 12 posts
* 2009: 12 posts
* 2012: 1 post
* 2013: 1 "post"
* 2015: 1 draft
* 2017: 1 draft, 1 post
* 2018: 1 post
* 2022: 1 post (so far)

and nothing in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2019, 2020 or 2021.

Which turns into just over 2 posts a year when averaging it all.
Turns out I knew what to expect when I set up permalinks for posts to
just include the year and skip months (and days).
