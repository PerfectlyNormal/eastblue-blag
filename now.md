Been busy with work and life and everything, with no time for any fun side projects.
So this is mostly dead. Hopefully that can change a bit now.

So much I want to do. So hard to focus on a single thing.

~~Turns out the GoodReads widget broke. Will have to look into that.~~

Replaced Goodreads with [Literal](https://literal.club)
